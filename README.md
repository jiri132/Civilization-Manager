# Civilization Manager

## Decription
You start of with a small tribe consisting beteen 5 to 15 people depending on how hard you want it to be.
you can assing them withto jobs as construction workers scienctist or farmers, when you have more housing spaces this wil randomly increase with the amount of construction workers you have, and if there is space then babys can be born, and your civilization GROOWWSS!

## How to win
When the civilization has become multi planetary and hasn't self destructed by a couple of causes like: Govermental Collapse, Nuclear fallout, War or Global warming

## In-depth idea
when your civilization grows so does co2 in the atmosphere to!
Try and keep your civilization from a mass extinction global warming event, you can control this by changing some policys like only using fossile feuls and going onto nuclear energy, but this can also cause fallouts and decrease your civilization and get radiation in the atmosphere slowly poisening your whole civilization.
So there are multiple ways to self destruct yourcivilization and try to keep everything undercontrol!
you win when your civilization has become multi planetary, when this game is finished I would like to make a DLC or a second version where you need to become a interstellar civilization and move up the cardeshev scale to infinite power.
But that would probably b realeased 3 years after this one will get released.

## Jobs
all the jobs have special usage
- Agrarian: Makes food for the civilization
- Miner: Collects sminerals neded for the civilization
- Carpenter: Gets all sorts of wood and makes the wood needed for buildings and weapons 
- Construction worker: Builds houses with the wood and minerals from the miner and carpenter
- Scientist: Randomly progresses on the techtree to unlock better houses aor discovers new minerals for a better usage of energy, or buildings
- Operatives: These people are "Government" make plans and regulate the civilization, and listen to YOU
